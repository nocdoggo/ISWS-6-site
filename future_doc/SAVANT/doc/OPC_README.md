## 4. Area of Interest

The experiments were conducted at the test field located at `Crowley Rd Mahomet Township, IL 61853`.

![OPC Device Location](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\ISWS-6-site\future_doc\SAVANT\doc\OPS_Location.png)

As shown in the picture above, there are 4 towers being constructed in the test field. The `OPC #1` was installed at `Release Tower` with a height of `3 meters`, and `OPC #2` was installed at `Lower Convergence Tower` with a height of `3 meters`. 

#### 4.1 Device Setup Profile

| Time Zone | Log Interval      | Type       |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| UTC       | 0:00:01 [H:MM:SS] | Continuous |



## 6. Data Spatial Type

The datasets have been converted to `.csv` and `.bin` file. 

#### 6.1 BIN File

`.bin` files include the device and firmware status, information, and maintenance record. File stored in ASCII encoding method.

#### 6.2 CSV File

`.csv` files include the experimental data, measuring methods, and plotting information. File stored in `comma-separated value` tabular form.



## 7. General Dataset Description

The device we are using is Optical Particle Sizer 3330 from TSI. Device information can be found at:

<https://www.tsi.com/optical-particle-sizer-3330/>

For the measurement, the device separates the molecule counts based on the size of the particle. At the beginning of each data file, you can find out that the machine categorizes particles into 17 bin groups.

| Bin                    | Size  |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Bin 1 Cut Point   (um) | 0.3   |
| Bin 2 Cut Point (um)   | 0.374 |
| Bin 3 Cut Point (um)   | 0.465 |
| Bin 4 Cut Point (um)   | 0.579 |
| Bin 5 Cut Point (um)   | 0.721 |
| Bin 6 Cut Point (um)   | 0.897 |
| Bin 7 Cut Point (um)   | 1.117 |
| Bin 8 Cut Point (um)   | 1.391 |
| Bin 9 Cut Point (um)   | 1.732 |
| Bin 10 Cut Point (um)  | 2.156 |
| Bin 11 Cut Point (um)  | 2.685 |
| Bin 12 Cut Point (um)  | 3.343 |
| Bin 13 Cut Point (um)  | 4.162 |
| Bin 14 Cut Point (um)  | 5.182 |
| Bin 15 Cut Point (um)  | 6.451 |
| Bin 16 Cut Point (um)  | 8.031 |
| Bin 17 Cut Point (um)  | 10    |

The data was collected with a time interval of `1 second` as mentioned previously.
